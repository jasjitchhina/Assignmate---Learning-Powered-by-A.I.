This app was created as a part of the Congressional App Challenge. 

Our app utilizes an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) document scanner to scan pages:

And then converts the scanned pages to text:

After clicking the "generate flashcards" button, our fine-tuned AI model creates a flashcard set based on the text scanned:

The app also includes an assignment tracker that lets the user input a course, assignment, points, level of importance, and due date/time.
